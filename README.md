![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Challenge

This challenge was completed using HTML and CSS. I used tailwind css to help with the styling, [Outfit font from Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit?query=outfit).

All the sizes in this challenge was approximated because the design files didn't have any sizes.

- Clone this repo
